GSO is an audio-visual interactive virtual instrument I fully designed and created in Pure Data using the GEM library (Graphics Environment for Multimedia), sound synthesis and user interaction via midi controls changes (CC). 

It is designed to produce abstract audio visual compositions, inspired by Pierre Schaeffer ‘sonorous objects’ theories and experiments that led to musique concrète, which inspired artists, sound designers, composers and audio developers to think beyond the usual method of sound creation, tone manipulation and listening.

To run and use the GSO you need: 

- Download Pd-extended : https://puredata.info/downloads
- Install Pd-extended 
- Downaload this patch
- Open GSO_openthis file
- Patch info can be found in [pd info] subpatch

Have fun...and share anything you may create using the GSO.
